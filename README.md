This github webpage provides source code (src) and summary statistics (summary statistics) for the paper "Cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analysis identifies six new loci for breast cancer in women of African and European ancestry" (Adedoku et al. 2021, Nature Communications).

The paper describes new breast cancer risk loci using a cross-ancestry GWAS approach. Variants associated with breast cancer at P<0.05 from African ancestry GWAS meta-analysis (9241 cases and 10192 controls) were meta-analyzed with European ancestry GWAS data (122977 cases and 105974 controls) from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. The approach identified four novel loci for overall breast cancer risk [1p13.3, 5q31.1, 15q24 (two independent signals), and 15q26.3] and two novel loci for estrogen receptor-negative disease (1q41 and 7q11.23) at genome-wide significance. Four of the index single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lie within introns of genes (KCNK2, C5orf56, SCAMP2, and SIN3A) and the other index SNPs are located close to GSTM4, AMPD2, CASTOR2, and RP11-168G16.2. The direction of the associations was consistent between the GWASs of African and European descendants. The study suggests that replication across multiple ancestry populations can help improve the understanding of breast cancer genetics and identify causal variants.
